What is vantage6?
-----------------

Vantage6 stands for pri\ **va**\ cy preservi\ **n**\ g
federa\ **t**\ ed le\ **a**\ rnin\ **g**\ infrastructur\ **e** for
\ **s**\ ecure \ **i**\ nsight e\ **x**\ change. Watch this
`video <https://youtu.be/HVHvlkAeuD0>`_ for a quick introduction.

The project is inspired by the `Personal Health Train <https://pht.health-ri.nl/>`_
(PHT) concept. In this analogy vantage6 is the *tracks* and *stations*.
Compatible algorithms are the *trains*, and computation tasks are the *journey*.

vantage6 is here for:

* delivering algorithms to data stations and collecting their results
* managing users, organizations, collaborations, computation tasks and their results
* providing control (security) at the data-stations to their owners

vantage6 is *not* (yet):

* formatting the data at the data station
* aligning data across the data stations

vantage6 is designed with three fundamental functional aspects of Federated learning.

1. **Autonomy**. All involved parties should remain independent and autonomous.
2. **Heterogeneity**. Parties should be allowed to have differences in hardware and operating systems.
3. **Flexibility**. Related to the latter, a federated learning infrastructure should not limit the use of relevant data.
