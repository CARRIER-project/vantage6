How to contribute
=================

If you're a developer
---------------------

.. note::
    Join our `Discord channel <https://discord.gg/tR7tqCt>`__, and get in touch
    with the *infrastructure developers.*

Fixing issues or adding features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
    **Found a security issue?** Please report it according to our
    `security policy <https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/SECURITY.md>`_
    guidelines.

Whenever you found an issue and wrote a fix or when you just want to
help improving the code, where happy that you want to contribute to the
code base. The process to submit a fix would be as follows:

1. Create an `issue <https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues>`_ on
   the Github page.
2. Create a branch starting with ``/bugfix`` in the case of a bug, or
   with ``/feature`` in the case of a new feature.
3. Implement your fix.
4. Push the branch and open a `Pull
   Request <https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pulls>`__.

Then it is out of your hands for now. A reviewer will look at the issue
and code and will request changes if needed. Once the code is finalized
it will be released as soon as possible (depening on the implications
this could be released as a patch version).

Maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  A great way to learn about the source is writing unit-tests to test
   existing components. This helps us getting our
   `coverage <https://coveralls.io/github/vantage6/vantage6>`__ up.
-  Maintaining good `code
   quality <https://app.codacy.com/gh/vantage6/vantage6/dashboard>`__ is
   important, so do some housekeeping. Refactoring and cleaning really
   helps us writing good code.
-  Writing documentation, both in the code and on this Documentation
   page.

If you're a tester (and breaker)
--------------------------------

-  Join our `Discord channel <https://discord.gg/tR7tqCt>`__, and get
   into the Development section.
-  Feel free to install our development version of vantage6 and try to
   break it.
-  Issues can be reported on our `Github
   page <https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6>`__.

If you're into security and/or privacy
--------------------------------------

One of the top priorities of vantage6 is being secure in what it does.
Therefore having people reporting possible security issues to us is
immensely helpful. If you have security concerns please report them
directly to vantage6@iknl.nl.
