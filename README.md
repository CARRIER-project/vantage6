# vantage6-master

This repository contains all the vantage6 packages as submodules. It is mainly used to store overarching files, like the `Dockerfile` and `Makefile`. Unless you're actively developing the vantage6 infrastructure, you should probably stay away from this repository.

See https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/submodule-vs-subtree-cheat-sheet/ for a helpful cheat sheet on how to use submodules.
