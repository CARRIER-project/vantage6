## :books: Documentation
This repository contains all the **vantage6** packages as submodules. It is mainly used to store overarching files, like the `Dockerfile` and `Makefile`. For more information on how to use submodules, [see this helpful cheat sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/submodule-vs-subtree-cheat-sheet/).

:warning: **Unless you're actively developing the vantage6 infrastructure, you should probably stay away from this repository.** :warning:

For a more detailed, comprehensive guide of other **vantage6** componentes, please refer to our [website (`https://vantage6.ai`)](https://vantage6.ai) and the official [documentation (`https://docs.vantage6.ai/`)](https://docs.vantage6.ai/).

## :gift_heart: Contributing
We hope to continue developing, improving, and supporting **vantage6** with the help of the federated learning community. If you are interested in contributing, first of all, thank you! Second, please take a look at our [contributing guidelines](https://docs.vantage6.ai/how-to-contribute/how-to-contribute)

## :lock_with_ink_pen: Data Protection Impact Assessment
Deploying Federated Learning solutions in real life often requires careful analysis and approval of a variety of legal entities. As part of these processes, we at IKNL have written a [Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), which you can find here](https://vantage6.ai/index.php/2020/07/08/dpia/). Please note that this DPIA was executed by IKNL and is specific for our situation. It can be used as an example by other organizations, but it cannot be used verbatim.
